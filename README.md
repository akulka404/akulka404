## üåü Signature Projects
<details open><summary><strong>Mini-MLOps Sentiment API üöÄ</strong></summary>
A production-grade microservice that turns raw text into sentiment labels in &lt;150 ms.

Built a FastAPI endpoint around a pretrained DistilBERT model, containerized it with Docker, and set up GitHub Actions CI/CD to push images to GHCR. A single click on Render deploys the latest tag, binding automatically to the platform-assigned port. The service exposes auto-generated Swagger docs, and a cURLable /predict route returning {label, score} JSON.

Designed for zero-downtime updates: every commit triggers an image build and redeploy, so new model versions or code fixes go live in minutes without manual intervention. The lean stack (FastAPI + Transformers + Uvicorn / Gunicorn) keeps memory usage under 300 MB, making the API cheap to host even on free tiers. Auth-ready middleware stubs and Evidently drift-report hooks are included for future expansion.

**Key Achievements:**
- Containerized a DistilBERT NLP microservice with FastAPI
- Automated GitHub Actions workflows and Render deployments
- Serving 5K+ requests at ~150 ms latency
- Seamless model versioning and drift-ready monitoring for data-centric AI applications

<details><summary><strong>J-Tracker üìÇ</strong></summary>
**Your Job Tracking Assistant**

The internship application and job application process is no picnic. Job application management is time-consuming. With the referrals and deadlines, the whole process can get daunting. Our app enables you to track and organize your job application process, and manage it, without the inconvenience of clunky Excel spreadsheets.

Our software maintains a record of the work you have wish-listed. It records those companies that you have applied for and records any rejections. Instead of making the user visit each company's website for prospects, our software enables the applicant to look for them directly using simple keywords. Any possible offer of work may then be wish-listed by the applicant.
